WEATHER APP ICON SETUP
======================

To add a custom weather icon to your app:

OPTION 1: Download a Weather Icon (Recommended)
------------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/weather_1163661
2. Download the icon as PNG (512x512 or 1024x1024)
3. Save it as "weather_icon.png" in this folder (assets/icon/)
4. Run: flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
5. Run: flutter run

OPTION 2: Use Your Friend's Icon
---------------------------------
Ask your friend to share their icon file and place it here as "weather_icon.png"

OPTION 3: Keep Current Android Icon
------------------------------------
Your app already works! The Android default icon is fine for development.

After adding the icon file, run this command:
    flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons

This will automatically generate all required icon sizes for Android.
